Description: A set of RStudio addins that are designed to be used in
             combination with user-defined RStudio keyboard shortcuts. These
             addins either:
             1) insert text at a cursor position (e.g. insert
             operators %>%, <<-, %$%, etc.),
             2) replace symbols in selected pieces of text (e.g., convert
             backslashes to forward slashes which results in stings like
             "c:\data\" converted into "c:/data/") or
             3) enclose text with special symbols (e.g., converts "bold" into
             "**bold**") which is convenient for editing R Markdown files.
